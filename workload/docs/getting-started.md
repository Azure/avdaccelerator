# Getting Started

This guide is designed to help you get started with deploying Azure Virtual Desktop using the provided Bicep template(s) within this repository. Before you deploy, it is recommended to review the template(s) to understand the resources that will be deployed and the associated costs.

This accelerator is to be used as starter kit and you can expand its functionality by developing your own deployments. It is meant for creating a new Azure Virtual Desktop workload, so it cannot be used to maintain, modify or add resources to an existing or already deployed Azure Virtual Desktop workload from this accelerator. You can however, destroy the existing workload and use this accelerator to create a new Azure Virtual Desktop workloads.

There are two solutions in the Azure Virtual Desktop Accelerator. Be sure to follow the guidance below for the appropriate solution:

- [Azure Virtual Desktop LZA - Baseline](./getting-started-baseline.md) - Azure Virtual Desktop
- [Azure Virtual Desktop LZA - Custom image build](./getting-started-custom-image-build.md) - Image Management using Azure Image Builder
