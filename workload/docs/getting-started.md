# Getting Started

This guide is designed to help you get started with deploying AVD using the provided Bicep template(s) within this repository. Before you deploy, it is recommended to review the template(s) to understand the resources that will be deployed and the associated costs.

This accelerator is to be used as starter kit and you can expand its functionality by developing your own deployments. It is meant for creating a new AVD workload, so it cannot be used to maintain, modify or add resources to an existing or already deployed AVD workload from this accelerator. You can however, destroy the existing workload and use this accelerator to create a new AVD workloads.

There are two solutions in the AVD Accelerator. Be sure to follow the guidance below for the appropriate solution:

- [Baseline](./getting-started-baseline.md) - Azure Virtual Desktop
- [Custom Image Build](./getting-started-custom-image-build.md) - Image Management using Azure Image Builder
