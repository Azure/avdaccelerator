# Adopt the Horizon Cloud and Azure Landing Zone Accelerator

VMware and Microsoft partnered together to accelerate the future of work. Employees need a consistent experience and seamless access to the applications and insights vital to doing their best work wherever work needs to get done – in the office, on the road, or at home.

This reference implementation adheres to the architecture and best practices of the Cloud Adoption Framework's Azure landing zones with a particular focus on the enterprise-scale design principles. Although this implementation can be deployed in any Azure environment that complies with the [prerequisites](https://github.com/Azure/avdaccelerator/blob/main/workload/docs/getting-started-baseline.md#prerequisites), It is recommended to use this solution after implementing an enterprise-scale landing zone, [enterprise-scale overview](../../ready/enterprise-scale/index.md) and [implementation guidance](../../ready/enterprise-scale/implementation.md) before deploying the enterprise-scale for Desktop Virtualization solution.

# Design areas – Identity and access management 
One method of accessing Horizon desktops and applications is through Workspace ONE Access. This requires integration between the Horizon Cloud Service and Workspace ONE Access using the SAML 2.0 standard to establish mutual trust, which is essential for single sign-on (SSO) functionality. 

### Identity and Access Management Design Considerations and Recommendations
Horizon Cloud on Microsoft Azure allows you to leverage Active Directory or Workspace ONE Access as an identity provider for users of the service. You can integrate your Horizon Cloud Service tenant with your Workspace ONE Access tenant to provide users with the ability to access Horizon Cloud desktops and applications from the Workspace ONE Intelligent Hub app and portal. This lets you provide users with a single place to access all their applications securely from multiple devices.
Note that Workspace ONE Access integrates with Microsoft Entra ID. See the [Platform Integration notes in the Reference Architecture](https://techzone.vmware.com/resource/service-integration#enterprise-productivity-service) for details. 

- Horizon Cloud on Microsoft Azure has built-in Single Sign-On capabilities via the True SSO feature. Architectural details about how True SSO can be implemented in Horizon Cloud on Microsoft Azure can be found in the [Reference Architecture](https://techzone.vmware.com/resource/horizon-cloud-on-microsoft-azure-architecture#true-sso). Details on leveraging True SSO to provide a single sign-on experience with Horizon Cloud on Microsoft Azure can be found in [Configure True SSO for Use with your Horizon Cloud Environment](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Horizon-Cloud-Service/services/hzncloudmsazure.admin15/GUID-451AF252-931C-418C-BD7F-288AE170F5A4.html).

- By default, Horizon Cloud on Microsoft Azure uses Active Directory for user access. Configuring it to use Workspace ONE Access is covered in [Identity Management Page in the Horizon Universal Console](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Horizon-Cloud-Service/services/hzncloudmsazure.admin15/GUID-49E2E9C3-222E-4200-9AD4-75B3D01211F4.html).

### Customer Profile
Consider the Horizon solution if: 
- You have already deployed VMWare Horizon on-premises and would like to continue to use the same platform in the future 
- You have decided on VMWare Horizon as your new desktop platform and wish to deploy into Azure or in a hybrid cloud model
- You wish to have a single control plane to manage Horizon on Azure or a hybrid deployment of Horizon 
- Critical applications or services are identified that will remain on-premises, in Azure, or in other cloud or hosted infrastructure platforms
- Your business leverages multiple cloud platforms for hosting critical applications
- Diverse user population requires access to services from anywhere



# Architectural Components
- Horizon Cloud on Microsoft Azure Architecture requires at least one [Microsoft Azure Virtual Network (Vnet)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview) to deploy platform and user components onto. This Vnet should contain at least three different subnets for management components of the service, a DMZ, and desktop capacity. 

- These subnets are used for the Horizon management appliances and customer-managed workload. Network security group (NSG) policies are applied on the Vnet, to allow and disallow traffic in and out of that Vnet, and to segregate that network into subnets. 

- You can select which Vnets and subnets are allowed to be used for desktop capacity. If you are using multiple Vnets for user capacity, you need to set up virtual networking peering between the Vnets in use. See [Virtual network peering](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview).

## Design Considerations and Recommendations 

Designing a multi-cloud solution is challenging and complex. VMware has developed guidance for deploying Horizon on each of the supported cloud-based infrastructure platforms. Review the different reference architectures for other platforms on the [Horizon Reference Architecture](https://techzone.vmware.com/reference-architecture#horizon) on VMware TechZone. 

# Design area – Identity
Typically, Horizon Cloud on Microsoft Azure integrates with Microsoft Entra ID or Workspace ONE Access for identity services. If you need to integrate a 3rd party prover like OKTA or OpenLDAP you can consider using Workspace ONE Access which has the ability to integrate with other LDAP providers.

Resources
Review the following resources on Identity integration.
- [Workspace ONE Access](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Workspace-ONE-Access/index.html)
- [Workspace ONE Access - Directory Integration](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Workspace-ONE-Access/services/ws1_access_directory/GUID-DF53F9EF-6715-469A-A885-9ACFE4B2A35B.html)
- [Horizon Cloud on Azure Architecture](https://techzone.vmware.com/resource/horizon-cloud-on-microsoft-azure-first-gen-architecture#authentication)


# Design area – Resource Organization 
Horizon Cloud on Microsoft Azure automatically configures and manages all the critical platform components that it creates on your behalf within Microsoft Azure. 

## Platform-Based Resources 
The following list provides more information about platform-based resources: 

- [Resource Groups](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Horizon-Cloud-Service/services/hzncloudmsazure.admin15/GUID-9F004F77-5685-400E-8ADC-3ECA96D3CA71.html) are automatically created for each pod to manage Azure Resources. 
- [Default Network Security Group Rules](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Horizon-Cloud-Service/services/hzncloudmsazure.admin15/GUID-202BDE8E-48BE-457A-AD96-8A866D935FDD.html#GUID-202BDE8E-48BE-457A-AD96-8A866D935FDD) are created to manage communications between pod components. 


## User Resources
User resources are organized and displayed in the Horizon Universal Console for administrators to manage. After a Horizon Edge or Horizon Pod has been deployed, you can import images, use them to create pool templates, pools, and entitle users to desktops and applications. 

### Images 

A virtual machine image can be imported from the Microsoft Azure Marketplace, the Microsoft Azure Compute Gallery, or from a Microsoft Azure Custom VM. After it is imported, you can remotely connect to the image and make changes such as installing applications. 

When an image is ready to use you publish it to the Horizon Edges where you want to use it. Publishing an image to a Horizon Edge copies the image to each provider in that edge, making it available for use in creating pools of virtual machines on that edge, and in any provider capacity assigned to that edge. 

App Volume Packages 

VMware App Volumes™ is an application packaging solution that provides real-time application delivery and life-cycle management for digital workspaces. App Volumes provides faster application delivery and simplified and unified management of apps and users, while at the same time reducing IT costs. App Volumes does this by abstracting Windows applications from the base operating system and delivering those applications through virtual disks. This is a different way of doing things, which enables you to clean up your golden desktop image and manage it separately from the applications that are installed. 

Using App Volumes applications functionality, you can manage the entire life cycle of applications, including packaging, updating, and retiring an application. You can also customize application assignments to deliver specific versions of an application to end users.  

Note: VMware App Volumes has different implementations and feature sets based on whether you use it with a [Horizon 8](https://techzone.vmware.com/resource/app-volumes-architecture) or a [Horizon Cloud on Microsoft Azure](https://techzone.vmware.com/resource/horizon-cloud-on-microsoft-azure-architecture#app-volumes-packages-in-horizon-cloud-on-microsoft-azure) deployment for your VDI and published desktop environment.  


### Desktop User Resources 

User resources in Horizon Cloud on Microsoft Azure consist of virtual machines created and managed by the service for end-user consumption as either: 

- Single User Desktops (VDI) 
- Multi-User Desktops and Workspaces (Multi-Session Desktops) 
- Applications (RDS Applications and Multi-Session Applications)

## Desktop and User Experience 

Regardless of the provisioning technology you choose (desktop or published application) or the type of desktop, a persistent user experience is about the way end users perceive their experience. From the end user’s perspective, it should feel like the session they use from day to day is always coming from the same VM. Settings, applications, and data persist from session to session, whether end users are accessing the same VM guest OS or not.   

Being able to dynamically apply saved profile settings that follow end users across devices and locations for a personalized desktop experience with every login is a critical feature for any remote desktop and application service implementation. 

VMware Dynamic Environment Manager delivers personalization and centrally managed policy configurations across virtual, physical, and cloud-based Windows desktop environments. IT administrators control which settings users are allowed to personalize, and administrators can map environmental settings such as network drives and location-specific printers. 

User-specific Windows desktop and application settings can be applied in the context of client device, location, or other conditions. Policies are enforced when users log in, launch an app, reconnect, or when some other triggering event occurs. Dynamic Environment Manager also has a feature for configuring folder redirection for storing personal user data, including documents, pictures, and so on.

# Design area – Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery
Organizations depend on Horizon to deliver key services to users. Proper design of the Horizon implementation can provide disaster recovery (DR) capabilities to ensure availability, recoverability, and business continuity. 

Disaster recovery for Horizon workloads should be viewed from the perspective of the users. Where a user is being delivered Horizon-based desktops or published applications from a particular location, contingencies should be made to provide equivalent services from a separate location. 

## Scenario 3: Designing a resilient Horizon Deployment 

A remote-first approach that relies on physical desktops is challenging and introduces many operational and security concerns. Providing disaster recovery for physical desktops is difficult, especially when combined with the need for the flexibility of a remote-first experience. 

By contrast, Horizon allows flexibility for providing disaster recovery to desktops and the applications. 

- Horizon is designed to allow users a remote and roaming experience, where they can access their desktop and applications from any device in any permitted location. 
- Horizon abstracts the desktop from the physical device. This allows the components that make up a user’s desktop and data to be replicated to alternative data centers or locations to provide site resiliency and disaster recovery. 
- Horizon offers multiple deployment options, from on-premises data centers to running in a variety of cloud platforms. This offers flexibility with regard to the consumption model and choice about the location of recovery services.

# Design area – Management baseline
You can use a variety of procedures for monitoring, diagnosing, and fixing problems that you might encounter when using VMware Horizon. Horizon Cloud on Microsoft Azure comes with built-in monitoring and reporting features.  

To maintain the health and efficient operation of any VDI platform, it is important to monitor for availability of critical platform and infrastructure components. 

## Design Considerations 

Every Virtual Workspace implementation is unique, bult on unique infrastructure implementations based on organizational requirements. It is critical to understand that a virtual workspace solution is reliant on all the infrastructure and environmental resource being available performant and secure.  

## Design Recommendations 

The following list of basic platform and infrastructure monitoring metrics should be measured and monitored for a healthy implementation.  

### Metrics and Alert Thresholds
