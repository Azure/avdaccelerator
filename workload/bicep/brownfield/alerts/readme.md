## Description

This solution provides a baseline of alerts for AVD that are disabled by default and for ensuring administrators and staff get meaningful and timely alerts when there are problems related to an AVD deployment. The deployment has been tested in Azure Global and Azure US Government and will incorporate storage alerts for either or both Azure Files and/or Azure Netapp Files.

## Prerequisites  

An AVD deployment and the Owner Role on the Subscription containing the AVD resources, VMs and Storage.  You must have also pre-configured the AVD Insights as it will enable diagnostic logging for the Host Pools and associated VMs in which the alerts rely on.  

## What's deployed to my Subscription?

Names will be created with a standard 'avdmetrics' in the name and vary based on input for things like site, environment type, etc.

Resource Group starting with the name "rg-avdmetrics-" with the following:  

- Automation Account with a Runbook (for Host Pool Information not otherwise available)  
- Identity for the Automation Account in which the name will start with "aa-avdmetrics-"
- Logic App that execute every 5 minutes (Host Pool Info Runbook)

The Automation Account Identity will be assigned the following roles at the Subscription level:

- Desktop Virtualization Reader
- Reader and Data Access (Storage Specific)

## What's the cost?

While this is highly subjective on the environment, number of triggered alerts, etc. it was designed with cost in mind. The primary resources in this deployment are the Automation Account and Alerts. We recommend you enable alerts in stages and monitor costs, however the overall cost should be minimal.  

- Automation Account runs a script every 5 minutes to collect additional Azure File Share data and averages around $5/month
- Alert Rules vary based on number of times triggered but estimates are under $1/mo each.

## Alerts Table

Table below shows the Alert Names however the number of alert rules created may be multiple based on different severity and/or additional volume or storage name designators. For example, a deployment with a single Azure Files Storage Account and an Azure NetApp Files Volume would yield 20 alert rules created. [(Excel Table)](./references/alerts.xlsx)

**NOTES:**  
:one: Alert based on associated Logic App and Runbook  
:two: See the following for custom condition. Note that both Standard and Premium values are incorporated into the alert rule. ['How to create an alert if a file share is throttled'](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-troubleshooting-files-performance#how-to-create-an-alert-if-a-file-share-is-throttled)  
Service Health - The alert severity cannot be set or changed from 'Verbose'  

[**Alert Reference**](alertReference.md)

## Deployment

Be sure to review the [PostDeployment](./postDeploy.md) documentation as the alerts are deployed in a disabled state by default. This will guide you through how to see the alerts by adjusting the filter and enabling them.  

The following parameters are optional:

1. AlertNamePrefix (Default will be "AVD" if not used)
2. StorageAccountResourceIds (Storage Account Alerts will not be deployed if not used)
3. ANFVolumeResourceIds (Azure NetApp Files Volume Alerts will not be deployed if not used)
4. Tags (No Tags will be set during deployment if not used)
