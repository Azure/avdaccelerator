[Please click this link to view and deploy from AMBA](https://azure.github.io/azure-monitor-baseline-alerts/patterns/specialized/avd/)

Azure Monitor Baseline Alerts has more than just AVD as well.  Also, with the move comes the repository that has all the same alerts you're used to and they are now vetted and approved by the Microsoft Product Group.  As of May 23,2024 the solution is the same but will be updated soon with some modifications to the overall solution so keep you're eyes on the new location's **What's New** section.
